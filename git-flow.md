# Git Flow Workflow
-----------------

## Hotfix

1. Create release in JIRA:

2. Code hotfix

    git co master
    git co -b hotfix/v1.29.3

    ... code ...

3. Test

  Deploy branch hotfix/v1.29.3 (Jenkins)

4. Release Hotfix

    git co master
    git log ..hotfix/v1.29.3 --stat
    git diff ...hotfix/v1.29.3 --stat
    git merge hotfix/v1.29.3
    git tag v1.29.3
    git push origin master
    git push origin v1.29.3

  Deploy tag v1.29.3 (Jenkins)

    git co develop
    git log ..hotfix/v1.29.3 --stat
    git diff ...hotfix/v1.29.3 --stat
    git merge hotfix/v1.29.3
    git push origin develop

  Deploy develop branch (Jenkins)

5. Check for **Meta Data** to be replicated

6. Create notification

  In Slack Channel "tp_oneteam":

        @here Release Notes
        v1.29.3

        ID-123: fix nasty bug

    git push origin :hotfix/v1.29.3


## Regular Release

Lets create a new release `1.30.0` from current `develop` branch

1. Create JIRA-Release `1.30.0` in JIRA

2. Create Release Branch

    git co develop
    git pull
    git diff v1.29.3... â€”stat                                                            # compare with last production release
    git log --no-merges --pretty='%s' v1.29.3.. | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq         # verify JIRA-IDs with JIRA-Release
    git co -b release/v1.30.0
    git push origin release/v1.30.0

3. Deploy Release v1.30.0 (via Jenkins)

4. Test Release (Smoke Test on Staging)

5. Tag Release in Master Branch

    git co master
    git diff ...release/v1.30.0 --stat
    git merge release/v1.30.0
    git tag v1.30.0
    git push origin master
    git push origin v1.30.0

    git co develop
    git diff ...release/v1.30.0 --stat                   # ... there are likely no changes, so no need to merge back

6. Deploy Tag v1.30.0 (via Jenkins)

7. Create Notification

  In Slack Channel "tp_oneteam":

        @here Release Notes
        v1.30.0

    git diff v1.29.3...v1.30.0 --stat
    git diff v1.29.3...v1.30.0 | grep Preference

9. Replicate from Staging --> Production

10. Clean Up

11. Delete release branch

    git push origin :release/v1.30.0


## Cherry Picked Release

Lets create a new release 1.31.0 of picked commits from develop branch
